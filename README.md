# idOS <3 XRPL; featuring: Oracles!

Spec on Notion: https://www.notion.so/idos-association/idOS-XRPL-integration-proposal-4a7c09f0b9b8470ca12e0db44b832647

XRPL devnet explorer: https://devnet.xrpl.org/

Credential only exist on XRPL's devnet, since the Credentials proposal hasn't been accepted yet.

- All current idOS functionality will work normally for XRPL, because we already support its signer. All XRPL Issuers and Consumers are free to use idOS like everyone else.
- If an Issuer or Consumer is built on XRPL, then they can use this [DepositPreauth](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/depositpreauth) thing that we tailored our spec to.
- To make this easier, we will offer (probably in a corner of the current SDKs) methods for create and accept XRPL credentials.
    - See [credential_create.ts](credential_create.ts).
- Also part of the grant is this niceness where you can create an AG on idOS by creating a Credential 2 (and the user accepting it, of course).
    - Note that the other way around will be something that we have to support. If an Issuer uses a dWG to create a credential and respective AG, they won't magically show up on XRPL. The Issuer still have to create Credential 1 (for the original) and Credential 2 (for its AG).
        - Note how this makes it really hard for the Issuer to set the timelock right in the XRPL Credential 2. See notes on [subscribe.ts](subscribe.ts).
- To make this work, we will have a Kwil Oracle that detects their creation in XRPL and does the equivalent AG creation (assuming the credential copy exists, etc).
    - See [subscribe.ts](subscribe.ts).
- Make sure to create an XRPL Credential usage guide, having the issuer and consumer guides be required reading, and how to use the above and the DepositPreauth.

Boom, wallet connected. ðŸš€
